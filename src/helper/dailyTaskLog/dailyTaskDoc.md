Here's a **simple explanation** of your `recoverMissedDailyTask` function along with complete **Markdown documentation** you can include in your project's README or internal documentation.

## ✅ `recoverMissedDailyTask` Function — Explained Simply

This function is designed to **automatically run a missed daily task** if your server was down or the cron job didn't run on time.

### 🧠 Why Use It?

Let’s say your cron job was scheduled for **22:05**, but your server crashed or restarted at 22:03 and came back at 22:30 — the job wouldn’t run. This function **detects** that the task didn’t run and **executes it once** as a backup.

# recoverMissedDailyTask Utility

This utility function checks if a scheduled daily task (e.g., cron job) was missed and attempts to run it if necessary. It is useful in case of server downtime, deployment restarts, or other issues where a scheduled task might not execute on time.

---

## ✅ Purpose

Ensure critical daily tasks (like storing user data, generating reports) still run **even if a cron job fails or is missed**.

---

## 📦 Import

```js
const recoverMissedDailyTask = require("./recoverMissedDailyTask");
```
````

---

## 🔧 Usage

```js
recoverMissedDailyTask("storeDataDaily", storeDataDaily, {
	hour: 22,
	minute: 5,
	graceMinutes: 15,
});
```

## 🧩 Parameters

| Name                   | Type       | Description                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `taskName`             | `string`   | Unique name of the task (e.g., `"storeDataDaily"`). Used for log tracking.        |
| `taskFunction`         | `function` | The function to run if the task was missed.                                       |
| `options`              | `object`   | Time window settings.                                                             |
| `options.hour`         | `number`   | Hour (24h format) when the task is scheduled to run (e.g., `22` for 10 PM).       |
| `options.minute`       | `number`   | Minute when the task is scheduled (e.g., `5` for 10:05 PM).                       |
| `options.graceMinutes` | `number`   | How long to wait after the scheduled time to still accept a run. Default is `15`. |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Calculates** the time window: from the scheduled time (`hour`, `minute`) to `graceMinutes` later.
2. **Checks** if:

   - The current time is **after** that grace period.
   - The task hasn't been marked as completed for today (`DailyTaskLog.lastRunAt < windowStart`).

3. If the task was missed, it:

   - Calls the `taskFunction`.
   - Updates the `DailyTaskLog` to reflect the task has now run.

---

## 📝 Example

```js
const storeDataDaily = require("./storeDataDaily");

recoverMissedDailyTask("storeDataDaily", storeDataDaily, {
	hour: 22,
	minute: 5,
	graceMinutes: 20,
});
```

---

## 🧪 Schema Required

Your `DailyTaskLog` schema should look like:

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const dailyTaskLogSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
	taskName: { type: String, unique: true },
	lastRunAt: { type: Date, default: null },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("DailyTaskLog", dailyTaskLogSchema);
```

---

## 🔔 Notes

- You should run this check **on server startup** to recover any missed task.
- It will **not re-run** the task if it already ran within the scheduled window + grace period.
- Safe to use alongside your existing cron job system.

```

Let me know if you want a version that supports **weekly tasks**, **monthly intervals**, or **logs retries in a separate collection**.
